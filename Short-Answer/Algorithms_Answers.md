#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n) - while loop only runs n times based on variable


b) O(n log n) - inner loop is running on less than what the outer loop is so total time will increase at a rate greater than the size of n


c) O(n) - runs for every bunny passed in

## Exercise II
Time Complexity - O(log n) Binary search
Pseudo Code:
• divide n-story building in half, and round down to middle ( // )
• check if egg breaks at middle point
• if broken, divide values < middle point ( // ) and repeat
• if egg not broken, divide the values > middle point ( // ) and repeat
• eventually after repeating that logic, you will find the break point level
